This is done via a [Discovery Magic Link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks/javascript-sdk#email-magic-links_methods_send-discovery-email) flow. After an End User is [authenticated](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks/javascript-sdk#email-magic-links_methods_authenticate-discovery-magic-link), an Intermediate Session is returned along with a list of associated Organizations.
     * The End User can then authenticate to the desired Organization by passing the Intermediate Session and `organization_id`. End users can even create a new Organization instead of joining or logging in to an existing one.
