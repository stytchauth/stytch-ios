     * The Discovery product lets End Users discover and log in to Organizations they are a Member of, invited to, or eligible to join.
     * Unlike our other B2B products, Discovery allows End Users to authenticate without specifying an Organization in advance. This is done via a [Discovery Magic Link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks/javascript-sdk#email-magic-links_methods_send-discovery-email) flow. After an End User is [authenticated](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks/javascript-sdk#email-magic-links_methods_authenticate-discovery-magic-link), an Intermediate Session is returned along with a list of associated Organizations.
     * The End User can then authenticate to the desired Organization by passing the Intermediate Session and `organization_id`. End users can even create a new Organization instead of joining or logging in to an existing one.
