# ``StytchUI``

Provides a pre-built, customizable, themeable, dark-and-light mode capable UI for authentication

## Overview
[Stytch](https://stytch.com) is an authentication platform, written by developers for developers, with a focus on improving security and user experience via passwordless authentication. Stytch offers direct API integrations, language-specific libraries, and SDKs (like this one) to make the process of setting up an authentication flow for your app as easy as possible.

The `StytchUI` client contains our pre-built UI components, and incorporates our headless SDK under-the-hood, so you can use both together, or the UI on it's own, depending on your project's needs.

Currently, only Stytch Consumer projects are supported.

The following products are fully supported:
* Email Magic Links
* Passwords
* Email, SMS, and WhatsApp OTP
* OAuth
